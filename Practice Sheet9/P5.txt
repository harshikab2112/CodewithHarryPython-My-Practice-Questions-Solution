i tried to enjoy the trip, but honestly, the whole experience was just #####.
from the moment we arrived, nothing went as planned.
the hotel lost our reservation, which was complete ########, and then we had to wait three hours in the lobby.
when we finally got a room, it was a total ######## dirty sheets, no towels, and the ac did not even work.
to top it all off, some drunk guy in the hallway kept yelling over a #### broken vending machine.
i swear, i needed a vacation from that vacation.
