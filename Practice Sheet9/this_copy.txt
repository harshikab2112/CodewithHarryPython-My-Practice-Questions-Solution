I love how adults said, "Enjoy your school days, real life is easier once you're free."
Oh yes, because waking up early to sit in traffic, answer 87 emails, pretend to care in meetings, and still wonder what’s for dinner at 9 p.m. is so much easier.
Honestly, I miss getting gold stars just for showing up in school - or those magical extra marks just because my handwriting didn't look like a doctor's prescription.
