## Practice Sheet 1: Modules, Comments & pip  

This repository contains practice questions from **Practice Sheet 1** of the CodeWithHarry Python Course, covering **modules, comments, and pip in Python**.  

---

### Concepts Covered:  

- **Modules in Python:**  
  - A module is a file that contains Python code (functions, classes, or variables) that can be reused.  
  - **Types of Modules:**  
    - **Built-in Modules** (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `math`).  
    - **User-Defined Modules** (custom Python scripts).  
    - **Third-Party Modules** (installed using pip, e.g., `numpy`, `requests`).  

- **Comments in Python:**  
  - Used to make the code more readable and explain logic.  
  - **Single-line comments** → `# This is a comment`  
  - **Multi-line comments** → `""" This is a multi-line comment """`  

- **pip (Python Package Installer):**  
  - Used to install, manage, and upgrade third-party libraries.  
  - **Installing a package:** `pip install package_name`  
  - **Upgrading a package:** `pip install --upgrade package_name`  
  - **Uninstalling a package:** `pip uninstall package_name`  
  - **Checking installed packages:** `pip list`  

This sheet provides a **basic understanding** of working with modules, writing comments, and managing packages using `pip`. 🚀
